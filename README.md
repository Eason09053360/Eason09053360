### Hi there 👋, I'm Eason!

I'm an Electrical Engineering student who prefers getting my hands dirty over writing generic developer introductions. 

**What I actually do:**
- **Hardware & DIY:** I love taking things apart and (usually) ：） putting them back together.
- **Software & Open Source:** When my hands aren't full of hardware components, I write code and actively contribute to open-source projects. 

**Off the keyboard:**
- **Go (Weiqi/Baduk):** I'm a 6-dan player. (Turns out debugging complex code requires the exact same mindset as calculating Go variations).
- **Badminton:** Always down for a good match to get away from the screen.
